                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India), while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
